# Uber-Data-Analysis
# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores and analyzes Uber ride data to uncover insights into ride patterns, customer behavior, and vehicle usage. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis focuses on trends, distributions, and relationships within the dataset.  

The goal is to demonstrate **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** skills, data visualization, and actionable insights that could be useful for business decisions or further machine learning models.

## 📊 Features of the Analysis  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Ride frequency by day, time, and month.  
  - Vehicle type usage distribution.  
  - Trip distance and fare distribution.  
  - Peak hours and demand patterns.  
- Visualizations using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for better understanding.

## 📈 Insights Gained  
- Shorter trips are mostly taken on **autos and bikes**, while **SUVs/premium cars** are used for longer rides.  
- **Booking Value** increases with distance, but pricing per km differs across vehicle types.  
- **Completed rides** show higher customer ratings compared to cancelled/incomplete rides.  
- Payment preferences vary, with some methods more common for high-value bookings.
